# Docker Installation
Follow the following steps for the installation of Docker on Ubuntu

1. Uninstall the older version of Docker if you have previously installed docker on your system.
```
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```
2. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over.
```
sudo apt-get update
```
```
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```
3. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
4. Now make sure to verify that GPG key is installed properly
```
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```
5. Use the following command to set up the stable repository.
```
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```
6. Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```
7. Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.
```diff
sudo docker run hello-world
```

# Docker Post Installation
Whenever we use the docker commands we have to give permissions, so in order to avoid using "sudo" to every commands write the following commands to your terminal
```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
Write these commands (instead of $USER you may write your host name like mine is asad). These are the post installation steps of docker. You can also visit official documentation from the link given below;
